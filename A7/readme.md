This is the music app that I have created.
In MusicApp.java you can run the main and interact with the UI I have made.
With this you can search for any artist, once you have searched for an artist you will have the option to narrow down
your song choice to an album and then from that album pick a specific song to add to either your music library
or a playlist that you want.
To add songs to your playlists they must first be present in the library.
